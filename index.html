                                    people having disability regarding their upper limb.This artificial limb senses the
                                    nerves
                                    sensitivity
                                    and folds the corresponding fingers and replicates the actions that the person is
                                    conveying.
                                    This projects uses Arduino-uno board as a controller.
                                    In most cases, a prosthesis is a tool that enables the patient to pinch or grasp an
                                    object
                                    and then manipulate the object with the intact upper limb. However, the fine
                                    manipulative,
                                    proprioceptive, and sensory functions of the hand cannot be duplicated by any of today’s
                                    prostheses, regardless of their sophistication. The reported rejection rate of upper

                                    myoelectric prostheses ranges from 0% to 50%.c Often, children (or parents) seek a
                                    prosthesis more for cosmetic purposes than for functional needs.

                                    The Robotic-Arm is a pick and place mobile controllable robot.
                                    This arm is fully controllable through the internet by giving different commands.
                                    The arm posses 6-degrees of freedom,all the motors in the arm can be fully controlled
                                    from the custom built application in the mobile phone over the internet.
                                    This bot is a prototype model of an industrial pick and place bot.
                                    The custom application used to control the movements of the arm is built in blynk
                                    application.
                                    To control the functionality of the Arm we used ARDUINO-UNO .
                                    All the parts of the arm are 3-d printed parts.
                                    We have used solidworks software for designing of parts.
                                    We used Ender-3 ,3d printer for printing the parts.
                                    The parts are printed/designed using the PLA(poly lactic acid) material,
                                    which is basically a type of plastic.

                                    This project is to calculate the distance position of the object placed at some distance
                                    from the sensor. Ultrasonic sensor sends the ultrasonic wave in different directions by
                                    rotating with help of servo motor. This wave travels in air and gets reflected back
                                    after
                                    striking some object. This wave is again sensed by the sensor and its characteristics is
                                    analysed and output is displayed in screen showing parameters such as distance and
                                    position
                                    of object.
                                    Arduino IDE is used to write code and upload coding in Arduino and helps us to sense
                                    position of servo motor and posting it to the serial port along with the distance of the
                                    nearest object in its path. If any object is detected, we get an alert message to the
                                    registered moble number
                                    Basically, an ultrasonic sensor sends ultrasonic waves which travels in air and gets
                                    reflected after striking any object. By studying the property of reflected wave, we can
                                    get
                                    knowledge about objects distance, position, speed etc.

                                    One of the most common application of ultra-sonic sensor is range finding. It is also
                                    called
                                    as sonar which is same as radar in which ultrasonic sound is directed at a particular
                                    direction and if there is any object in its path it strikes it and gets reflected back
                                    and
                                    after calculation time taken to come back we can determine distance of object. in real
                                    life
                                    this method is used by bats.

                                    Telepresence refers to technologies that allow a user appear to be present, feel like
                                    they
                                    are present or have some effect in a space the person does not physically inhabit.
                                    Telepresence can include video teleconferencing tools, where a picture and audio stream
                                    is
                                    conveyed to a remote location, as well as more involved robotics installations that can
                                    actually help a user to accomplish tasks from a remote location.
                                    Advanced telepresence equipment and resources can be used in many industries, from
                                    health
                                    care to manufacturing. Robotics and other types of practical IT could make telepresence
                                    tools that much more powerful, allowing all sorts of cyber-interactions over networks.

                                    Much of the audiovisual telepresence technology is sold as rack space server equipment
                                    with
                                    installed applications that manage a teleconference, including security, scheduling,
                                    call
                                    handling and other aspects of use. These versatile solutions can save businesses a lot
                                    of
                                    money and effort in setting up effective meetings or conferences.
